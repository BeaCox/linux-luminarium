Challenges in pwn.college are in the `challenge` directory that is, in turn, right in the root directory (`/`).
The path to the challenge the directory is, thus, `/challenge`, and the path to the `run` challenge program is `/challenge/run`.
This style of path, one that starts with the root directory, is referred to as an "absolute path".
From the commandline, you can execute programs by refering to them by their absolute paths.

This challenge requires you to execute it by invoking its absolute path.
You'll want to execute the `run` file that is in the `challenge` directory that is, in turn, in the `/` directory.
If you invoke the challenge correctly, it will give you the flag.
Good luck!
