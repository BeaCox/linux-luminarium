The Linux filesystem has tons of directories with tons of files.
You can navigate around directories by using the `cd` (`c`hange `d`irectory) command and passing a path to it, as so:

```
$ cd /some/new/directory
```

This challenge will require you to execute the `/challenge/run` program from a specific path (which it will tell you).
You'll need to `cd` to that directory before rerunning the challenge program.
Good luck!
