Welcome to the Linux Luminarium!
This dojo will gently teach you how to use the Linux command line interface.
This is far from the only resource like this on the internet, and we will strive to link to others where appropriate.

We do our best to avoid requiring any knowledge of Linux, but we do expect you to have learned [how to use the dojo infrastructure itself](/welcome).

**NOTE:**
This dojo is a work in progress *and* a community effort!
