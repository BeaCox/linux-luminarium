This module will expose you to some useful Linux commands that will serve you well for the rest of your journey here!
A command is entered on a terminal, like so:

```
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Hello Hackers!
Hello Hackers!
```

The first word is the command, and subsequent words are *arguments*.
In this case, the command was `echo`, and `Hello` and `Hackers!` were the two arguments to `echo`.
`echo` is a simple command that "echoes" the arguments back out onto the terminal, like you see in the session above.

So, without further ado, let's learn some commands!
