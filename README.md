# The Linux Luminarium

This is a [pwn.college](https://pwn.college) dojo built around teaching basic Linux knowledge, through hands-on challenges, from absolutely no knowledge.
The intention is to teach aspiring hackers enough skills to tackle the rest of the pwn.college curriculum (at least in terms of Linux knowledge)!
