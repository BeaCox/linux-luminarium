This level is tricky: it hides the manpage for the challenge by randomizing its name.
Luckily, all of the man pages are gathered in a searchable database, so you'll be able to search the man page database to find the hidden challenge man page!
To figure out how to search for the right man page, read the `man` page manpage by doing: `man man`!

NOTE: though we overwrite a manpage of a random command, you still actually use `/challenge/challenge` to get the flag!
