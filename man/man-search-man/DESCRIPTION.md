This level is tricky: it hides the manpage for the challenge by randomizing its name.
You'll have to search the man page database to find it!
To figure out how to search for the right man page, read the `man` page manpage by doing: `man man`!

NOTE: though we overwrite a manpage of a random command, you still actually use `/challenge/challenge` to get the flag!
