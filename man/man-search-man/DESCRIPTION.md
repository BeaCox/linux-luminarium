This level is tricky: it hides the manpage for the challenge by overwriting a random different manpage.
You'll have to find the right man page!
To figure out how to search for the right man page, read the `man` page manpage by doing: `man man`!

NOTE: though we overwrite a manpage of a random command, you still actually use `/challenge/challenge` to get the flag!
