This level introduces the `man` command.
`man` is short for `manual`, and will display (if available) the manual of the command you pass as an argument.
For example, let's say we wanted to learn about the `yes` command (_yes_, this is a real command):

```console
hacker@dojo:~$ man yes
```

This will display the manual page for `yes`, which will look something like this:

```man
YES(1)                           User Commands                          YES(1)

The important sections are:

```
NAME
	This gives the name (and short description) of the command or
	concept discussed by the page.

SYNOPSIS
	This gives a short usage synopsis. These synopses have a stanard
	format. Typically, each line is a different valid invocation of the
	command, and the lines can be read as:

	COMMAND [OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT] SINGLE_MANDATORY_ARGUMENT
	COMMAND [OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT] MULTIPLE_ARGUMENTS...

DESCRIPTION
	Details of the command or concept, with detailed descriptions
	of the various options.

SEE ALSO
	Other man pages or online resources that might be useful.
```

You can scroll the man page with the arrow keys (and PgUp/PgDn) and search with `/`.
When you're done reading the manpage, you can hit `q` to quit.

The challenge in this level has a secret option that, when you use it, will cause the challenge to print the flag.
You must learn this option through the man page for `challenge`!
